# GorillaMotion for GorillaLocomotion
An unnoficial update that adds new functionality. Original gorillalocomotion package will also need to be installed to use

**99% of the code is by LemmingVR and not me: Please star the original and not mine!**

This is currently WIP so see you soon!

# Progress update!
### Just need a few more features but may still take a bit as I am also working on my own game lol

## Roadmap

Add vibration

Ability to add custom hit sounds for any surface

Fix Oculus Quest 2 not working correctly on build

Easy support for player models.

Easy online support with Photon

Easy voicechat support

Easy cosmetics support [NEW]



### **If Lemming would like me to delete this, I am happy to do so!**
### Just in case, I do not own the gorilla tag player. Also, do NOT make a gorilla tag clone and instead make something unique as lemming said on the original

##About editing
Feel free to edit this as much as you want, but I would preferably want you to fork this repository if you do share it. Thank you!
