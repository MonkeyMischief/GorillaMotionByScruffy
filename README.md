# GorillaMotion for GorillaLocomotion
An unnoficial update that adds new functionality. Original gorillalocomotion package will also need to be installed to use

**99% of the code is by LemmingVR and not me: Please star the original and not mine!**

This is currently WIP so see you soon!

# Progress update!
### Had to restart but I will start work on it again soon!

## Roadmap

Add vibration

Fix / Remake Slippery Surfaces

Ability to add custom hit sounds for any surface

Fix Oculus Quest 2 not working correctly on build

Easy support for player models.

Easy online support with Photon

Easy voicechat support

Easy cosmetics support [NEW]



### **If Lemming would like me to delete this, I am happy to do so!**
### Just in case, I do not own the gorilla tag player. Also, do NOT make a gorilla tag clone and instead make something unique as lemming said on the original

## About editing
Feel free to edit this as much as you want, but I would preferably want you to fork this repository if you do share it. Thank you!

## About using in your project
Use is free but I would like you to credit me and lemming somewhere
