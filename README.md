# GorillaLocomotion Updated
An unnoficial update that adds new functionality

**99% of the code is by LemmingVR and not me: Please star the original and not mine!**

This is currently WIP so see you soon!

## Roadmap
Add vibration
Ability to add custom hit sounds
Fix Oculus Quest 2 Bug
Easy support for player models.

If Lemming would like me to delete this, I am happy to do so!
